I worked as a designer and publisher in Damaaz The Barbarian Warlock. Published in December 2023 in Steam, this Jamk BIT student project demo aimed to create a single player fast-paced Beat 'em Up action game with unique, comic style line art. Inspired by Sword and Sorcery, the plunge into the dark fantasy world and challenging NES era gameplay aims to invoke the nostalgia of when the player could play the game over the weekend with their friends.

Demolab

The fall semester of third year BIT students at Jamk involves a DemoLab, which simulates work projects with game projects that are published on Steam.

DemoLab starts off with students pitching their ideas to the whole class, from which a number of projects are chosen to be developed further for publishing. Opportunity to work on designing a Hack and Slash Beat 'em Up game was exciting. I was able to work as designer, being in charge of the gameplay feel and flow, enemy behaviour planning, level layout planning and other things involving the game. A lot of these elements were directly implemented by me as well into the Unity project. I wanted to learn publishing with this project as well, so I jumped at the change to handle the process involved with Steam publishing. Testing sessions and feedback gatherings were also a part of my responsibilities during the project.

Design

Presentation material of Damaaz The Barbarian Warlock

I came into the project with a clear concept already present from the product owners' original pitch. The general ideas were there, so it was time to focus on the details and working on fine tuning the gameplay feel that was desired to the product. All the team members had ideas and feedback on various gameplay elements, which were gathered and organized into our Game Design Document (GDD). Team's coders and artists needed details on mechanics and assets quickly so those were prioritized due to the short production time.

Asset plan sketches

For artists I provided rough sketches on how items should work, for an example some traps and breakable objects as seen in above pictures. For coders, entire sequences of gameplay sketches were needed so they could add functionalities and plan sequencing them into functional pieces to be used. I used storyboards, similar as used in film and animation production to convey action sequences to the rest of the team. This synergized well with the later development of the game's encounter system, where an area seen at once on game's camera could define encounter areas. This view made it clear for everyone involved what should be seen by the player at any one time. There were also enough space left for team inputs, as there are things that coders, artists or implementation people can adjust as an evolution of the original design. 

Level design sketches

Level design followed a similar philosophy, where there was space left for the team to provide input, allowing us to make adjustments on a short notice to changing needs of the project. As this was a team effort of highly motivated students working together, creative input and revisions to design was very enjoyable. Time restrictions forced the technical and artistic team members to be able to influence the design, otherwise we could not have delivered as polished of a product as we wanted.

Implementing

Enemy types and behaviours went through several iterations throughout the production, with many features left half finished within the game's files or not implemented due to the limited time of the production schedule.
